I'm Valentin Daniel Rudloff a 27-year-old engineer who enjoys developping its skills at programming, photographing, engineering. He is pragmatic and commited, but can also be very bounded and a bit impatient.

I am French and speak English and German. I post-graduated in transport engineering at Estaca specialized in Embeeded Software in 2017. I taught myselft programming, making robots and I'm now a Software Release Manager at [Navya](https://www.navya.tech).

# Hobbies
I love learning, programming, conceptualise/build/program robots, fly quadcopters, photographing beautiful landscapes, hiking tall and steep mountains.

# Where do I come from
I lived in Germany for 4 years when I was little before grewing up in a working class neighbourhood near Le Mans, France. My mother is a Agricultural Ministerial research fellow. And my father is a Molding Expert Engineer.

# Career
I started my professionnal carrer in the company [Navya](https://www.navya.tech) as a Software Engineer in the Driving Team. I wanted to know more about the technology behind the autonomous mini-bus manufactured by Navya in Lyon. I took the train from Paris to Lyon several time a month to test with my team new software. I learned a lot during this period and as time went by I began to emancipate myself and start my own professionnal projects. I created the project [Assisted Manual Driving or AMD](projects) to show Navya's developer the way to use the newly installed bug/issue/specifications/development tracability tool, [Codebeamer](https://codebeamer.com/). The success of the project showed that I can have more responsabilities in projects and that's why I became Technical Project Manager in the Autonomous Tract Joint Venture project with [Charlatte](https://charlattemanutention.fayat.com/fr/produits/autonomr-tract-tracteur-autonome). Now I work as a Release Manager at [Navya](https://www.navya.tech). As a Release Manager I provide a Quality gate in terms of integration of the Embedeed Software evolution before its validation on simulation and test bench and vehicle [for more details](release_manager). 

# Professionnal projects 
I worked on [Vehicule Cinematic/Dynamic Simulation](projects), [Robotic control optimization](robotic_control) , [Assisted Manual Driving](projects), [Tract](projects)

# My personnal projects
I created some projects such as [Air model](projects), [Minetower](projects), [Cube Escape](projects)

# What's my future like
I definitly will continue to master my skills to become more and more confident in them. I will strengthen my knowledge in the Quality Assurance methods, processes, tools. My desire to build up a product thanks to technical solution that turns into a business is undoubtly in the back of my head.
